# Release Notes

## Unreleased

- Breaking: `s2and-rust` is now a required runtime dependency of `s2and`.
  `uv pip install s2and` installs the Rust package; `s2and[rust]` remains only
  as a compatibility alias.
- Breaking: removes the Sinonym-dependent `ANDData` rewrite API. `ANDData(...)`
  no longer accepts `use_sinonym_overwrite` or `sinonym_overwrite_min_ratio`;
  callers must provide upstream-normalized names before constructing `ANDData`.
- Arrow-backed training ingestion now streams IPC record batches for
  signatures/papers/authors and skips Python SPECTER embedding materialization
  by default when Rust featurization is attached. Pass
  `load_python_specter=True` only for Python reference featurization or direct
  Python embedding access.

## 0.51.1

- Ships the package as `0.51.1` and pins optional Rust installs to `s2and-rust==0.51.1`.
- Makes Arrow IPC the production Rust runtime boundary. Direct prediction now uses `Clusterer.predict_from_arrow_paths(...)` or Arrow-routed `Clusterer.predict(...)` over `signatures`, `papers`, `paper_authors`, selected `specter`, raw-planner batch indexes, and shared `name_counts_index`. JSON/`ANDData` remains available for compatibility, training, fixtures, and parity checks.
- Adds canonical Arrow runtime contracts and tooling: `s2and.arrow_inputs`, `s2and/arrow_schema_contract.json`, `scripts/convert_to_arrow.py`, `scripts/arrow_conversion_helpers.py`, local Arrow release validation, and bounded parity/quality verification scripts. The documented public data release is now `s2and-release-arrow`; the legacy JSON/pickle release remains for paper-era inputs.
- Tightens production validation. Missing or malformed Arrow artifacts now raise structured `MissingArrowArtifactError` failures, Rust production routes fail fast instead of silently falling back to `ANDData`, unsupported name-alias path keys are rejected, and direct Arrow prediction refuses models that require reference features.
- Reworks promoted incremental linking around Arrow/Rust. The promoted path reads base Arrow artifacts, query signatures, cluster seeds, cluster seed disallows, and altered-profile sidecars; Rust performs raw candidate planning and promoted row-signal construction; `batching_threshold` controls promoted Rust query batch size.
- Switches promoted linker replay/training to `--feature-mode arrow-rust` by default against the canonical `s2and_and_big_blocks_linker_dataset_20260525` Arrow+labels bundle. `precomputed-promoted` remains an explicit reuse mode.
- Uses the manifest-backed binary `name_counts_index/` sidecar as the Rust hot-path name-count artifact. Embedded Arrow name-count columns are no longer the runtime direction, and `name_counts.arrow` is generation, inspection, and parity-debugging only.
- Updates model, eval, tutorial, and profiling flows for Arrow-first operation. `eval_prod_models.py` can auto-use Arrow when complete artifacts exist, the production tutorial defaults to Arrow input, the documented model path is the native `production_model_v1.21/` bundle, and `rust_suite.py promoted-incremental-arrow-profile` replaces the legacy big-block incremental profiler.
- Adds graph subblocking as the default fallback for oversized name groups and introduces strict Arrow-native Rust graph subblocking with batch-indexed reads, expanded telemetry, ORCID repair behavior, and scoped dash-name compatibility.
- Narrows the Rust production surface to one route per job. Legacy/debug bridge APIs are removed or demoted, including raw FeatureBlock scoring, string-pair constraint matrix APIs, retriever debug APIs, aggregate-only linker helpers, and `s2and/rust_capabilities.py`.
- Clarifies cache behavior for the new runtime boundary. Direct Arrow/Rust production prediction bypasses the persistent pair-feature SQLite cache, Rust featurizer reuse is invalidated by cluster-seed changes, and artifact cache entries no longer probe raw-ETag filenames.

## Rust extension 0.50.0

- `s2and-rust>=0.50.0` is required for Rust-backed incremental linking.
- Native extension load failures now surface as import errors instead of silently falling back to Python. Missing extension modules still use the Python fallback path.
- Incremental linking uses the NumPy logistic link-or-abstain gate artifact format; legacy score/margin gate thresholds are not supported.
- Production linker finalization trains the final booster on train plus weighted calibration splits, then calibrates the final logistic gate on the held-out test split.
- Incremental name compatibility now accepts joined and first-token aliases in addition to exact first-name tuples.
- Artifact cache entries are keyed by validator type. Raw-ETag cache filenames are no longer probed.
