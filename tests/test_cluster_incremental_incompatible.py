        A and Alec would be allowed normally.
        A and the first Alan are seeded in a cluster together.
        The only feature in this test is affiliation similarity, and (1,3) and (2,4) each
        have the same affiliation, and so the pairwise model would rate them as similar.

        Given all of this, the expected outcome is that, when we prevent new incompatibilities,
        Alec does not get added to the seeded cluster, but the second Alan does. When we do not
        prevent new incompatibilities, all the signatures should end up in a cluster together.
