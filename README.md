# S2AND
This repository provides access to the S2AND dataset and S2AND reference model described in the paper `S2AND: A Benchmark and Evaluation System for Author Name Disambiguation` by Shivashankar Subramanian, Daniel King, Doug Downey, Sergey Feldman (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07534).

The reference model will be live on semanticscholar.org later this year, but the trained model is available now as part of the data download (see below).

## Installation
To install this package, run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allenai/S2AND.git
cd S2AND
conda create -y --name s2and python==3.7
conda activate s2and
pip install -r requirements.in
pip install -e .
```

To obtain the training data, run this command after the package is installed (from inside the `S2AND` directory):  
```[Expected download size is: 50.4 GiB]```

`aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://ai2-s2-research-public/s2and-release data/`

If you run into cryptic errors about GCC on macOS while installing the requirments, try this instead:
```bash
CFLAGS='-stdlib=libc++' pip install -r requirements.in
```

## Configuration
Modify the config file at `data/path_config.json`. This file should look like this
```
{
    "main_data_dir": "absolute path to wherever you downloaded the data to",
    "internal_data_dir": "ignore this one unless you work at AI2"
}
```
As the dummy file says, `main_data_dir` should be set to the location of wherever you downloaded the data to, and
`internal_data_dir` can be ignored, as it is used for some scripts that rely on unreleased data, internal to Semantic Scholar.

## How to use S2AND for loading data and training a model
Once you have downloaded the datasets, you can go ahead and load up one of them:

```python
from os.path import join
from s2and.data import ANDData

dataset_name = "pubmed"
parent_dir = "data/pubmed/
dataset = ANDData(
    signatures=join(parent_dir, f"{dataset_name}_signatures.json"),
    papers=join(parent_dir, f"{dataset_name}_papers.json"),
    mode="train",
    specter_embeddings=join(parent_dir, f"{dataset_name}_specter.pickle"),
    clusters=join(parent_dir, f"{dataset_name}_clusters.json"),
    block_type="s2",
    train_pairs_size=100000,
    val_pairs_size=10000,
    test_pairs_size=10000,
    name=dataset_name,
    n_jobs=8,
)
```

This may take a few minutes - there is a lot of text pre-processing to do.

The first step in the S2AND pipeline is to specify a featurizer and then train a binary classifier
that tries to guess whether two signatures are referring to the same person. 

We'll do hyperparameter selection with the validation set and then get the test area under ROC curve.

Here's how to do all that:

```python
from s2and.model import PairwiseModeler
from s2and.featurizer import FeaturizationInfo
from s2and.eval import pairwise_eval

featurization_info = FeaturizationInfo()
# the cache will make it faster to train multiple times - it stores the features on disk for you
train, val, test = featurize(dataset, featurization_info, n_jobs=8, use_cache=True)
X_train, y_train = train
X_val, y_val = val
X_test, y_test = test

# calibration fits isotonic regression after the binary classifier is fit
# monotone constraints help the LightGBM classifier behave sensibly
pairwise_model = PairwiseModeler(
    n_iter=25, calibrate=True, monotone_constraints=featurization_info.lightgbm_monotone_constraints
)
# this does hyperparameter selection, which is why we need to pass in the validation set.
pairwise_model.fit(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)

# this will also dump a lot of useful plots (ROC, PR, SHAP) to the figs_path
pairwise_metrics = pairwise_eval(X_test, y_test, pairwise_model.classifier, figs_path='figs/', title='example')
print(pairwise_metrics)
```

The second stage in the S2AND pipeline is to tune hyperparameters for the clusterer on the validation data
and then evaluate the full clustering pipeline on the test blocks.

We use agglomerative clustering as implemented in `fastcluster` with average linkage.
There is only one hyperparameter to tune.

```python
from s2and.model import Clusterer, FastCluster
from hyperopt import hp

clusterer = Clusterer(
    featurization_info,
    pairwise_model,
    cluster_model=FastCluster(linkage="average"),
    search_space={"eps": hp.uniform("eps", 0, 1)},
    n_iter=25,
    n_jobs=8,
)
clusterer.fit(dataset)

# the metrics_per_signature are there so we can break out the facets if needed
metrics, metrics_per_signature = cluster_eval(dataset, clusterer)
print(metrics)
```

For a fuller example, please see the transfer script: `scripts/transfer_experiment.py`.

## How to use S2AND for predicting with a saved model
Assuming you have a clusterer already fit, you can dump the model to disk like so
```python
import pickle

with open("saved_model.pkl", "wb") as _pkl_file:
    pickle.dump(clusterer, _pkl_file)
```

You can then reload it, load a new dataset, and run prediction
```python
import pickle

with open("saved_model.pkl", "rb") as _pkl_file:
    clusterer = pickle.load(_pkl_file)

anddata = ANDData(
    signatures=signatures,
    papers=papers,
    specter_embeddings=paper_embeddings,
    name="your_name_here",
    mode="inference",
    block_type="s2",
)
pred_clusters, pred_distance_matrices = clusterer.predict(anddata.get_blocks(), anddata)
```

Our released models are in the `s3` folder referenced above, and are called `production_model.pickle` and `full_union_seed_*.pickle`. They can be loaded the same way, except that the pickled object is a dictionary, with a `clusterer` key.

### Incremental prediction
There is a also a `predict_incremental` function on the `Clusterer`, that allows prediction for just a small set of *new* signatures. When instantiating `ANDData`, you can pass in `cluster_seeds`, which will be used instead of model predictions for those signatures. If you call `predict_incremental`, the full distance matrix will not be created, and the new signatures will simply be assigned to the cluster they have the lowest average distance to, as long as it is below the model's `eps`, or separately reclustered with the other unassigned signatures, if not within `eps` of any existing cluster.

## Reproducibility
The experiments in the paper were run with the python (3.7.9) package versions in `paper_experiments_env.txt`. You can install these packages exactly by running `pip install pip==21.0.0` and then `pip install -r paper_experiments_env.txt --use-feature=fast-deps --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver`. Rerunning on the branch `s2and_paper` should produce the same numbers as in the paper (we will udpate here if this becomes not true).
